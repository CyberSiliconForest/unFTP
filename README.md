# unFTP

When you need FTP, but don't want to.

With unFTP, you can present FTP to the outside world while freeing yourself to use all the modern APIs and techniques you want to.
By storing everything in Google Buckets and authenticating against an external service it requires no local state.

unFTP is currently very much under development and totally not usable yet.
